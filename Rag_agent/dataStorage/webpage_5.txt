Overview

Program Requirements



We offer cutting-edge expertise in a variety of courses that combine technological advances and business practices. We stress creative and inventive approaches to problem solving, which necessitates empowering students so that they can take charge of their own software projects to become originally productive. Our information systems program is as much an art as a science. It bypasses mechanical learning and highlights the value and excitement of engineering thinking that gets things done efficiently as well as imaginatively. We balance theory and practice, on the premise that they are always intertwined and interdependent. We seek to provide a basic foundation for our students and then seek to push them to new heights to advance their information technology skills in a way that keeps up and, better yet, exceeds the necessarily fast pace of this progressive field. It is not for us just a question of not being left behind; we strive to be at the forefront of software innovation in an effort to transform contemporary society even more radically than technology has already done—to take gigantic strides in business, medicine, education, and security.  The program offers a wide range of courses that reflect current and future industry trends:   Cryptocurrency and Smart Contract Engineering   Engineering of Big-Data Systems   Business Intelligence and Data Analytics   Cyber-Security Engineering and Development   Digital Business   Full-Stack Software Engineering   User Experience Design   Data Science and Machine Learning Systems Engineering   Gordon Institute of Engineering Leadership Master's Degree in Information Systems with Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership Students may complete a master's degree in Information Systems in addition to earning a Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership. Students must apply and be admitted to the Gordon Engineering Leadership Program in order to pursue this option. The program requires fulfillment of the 16-semester-hour curriculum required to earn the Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership, which includes an industry-based challenge project with multiple mentors. The integrated 32-semester-hour degree and certificate will require 16 hours of advisor-approved information systems technical courses.

   Concentrations and course offerings may vary by campus and/or by program modality.  Please consult with your advisor or admissions coach for the course availability each term at your campus or within your program modality.  Certain options within the program may be required at certain campuses or for certain program modalities.  Please consult with your advisor or admissions coach for requirements at your campus or for your program modality.

Overview

Program Requirements



With the proliferation of data across all sectors of the global economy, there is an immediate need for individuals to be knowledgeable in how to harness this data for continuous analysis and study. This spectrum spans from commercial to nonprofit, from higher education to government, and is constantly expanding with new sectors as data mining becomes the standard for knowledge gathering in the digital age. The Master of Professional Studies in Analytics helps to meet the demand from employers with a graduate program that provides students with an end-to-end analytics education through a core curriculum with integrated experiential learning opportunities. The program is designed to prepare students with a deep understanding of the mechanics of working with data (i.e., its collection, modeling, and structuring), along with the capacity to identify and communicate data-driven insights that ultimately influence decisions. Not only will students graduate with a portfolio of work samples that demonstrate their range and depth of skill, they will be part of a larger network of analytics professionals who will serve them now and in the future.  Build portfolios of real-world projects demonstrating competency with key technologies, visualization and communication techniques, and the ability to translate information into recommended actions. Gain a core analytical skill set upon which to layer more specialized technical skill sets or industry-specific applications. Develop a relationship to industry leaders and peers so that you may leverage your Northeastern education long after your formal education ends. Choose from a host of flexible programming options—all of which share an industry-defined core curriculum and a required, credit-bearing experiential requirement. Anticipate and contribute to the future direction of data analytics. 

   Concentrations and course offerings may vary by campus and/or by program modality.  Please consult with your advisor or admissions coach for the course availability each term at your campus or within your program modality.  Certain options within the program may be required at certain campuses or for certain program modalities.  Please consult with your advisor or admissions coach for requirements at your campus or for your program modality.   
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated. Required Courses  Course List        Code Title Hours    Note: ITC 6000 is for students without prior educational or professional experience with data and database structures. Students who do not complete ITC 6000 must complete a third elective course to reach 45 quarter hours.

Overview

Program Requirements



Companies succeed or fail based on their ability to bring quality products and services to market in a timely manner. Without skilled project managers in place, companies are challenged to deliver projects on time, on budget, and according to specifications. From inception to completion, project managers are responsible for every step in the process: project definition, cost and risk estimation, schedule planning and monitoring, budget management, negotiation and conflict resolution, project leadership, and project presentation and evaluation. The Master of Science in Project Management is designed to provide you with the practical skills and theoretical concepts you need to lead complex projects. Featuring real-world case studies, this project management degree presents techniques and tools for managing long- and short-term projects successfully and cost-effectively. Augmenting the core project management courses are concentrations that seek to provide you with content-specific expertise that enables you to deepen your knowledge in your field of interest. In October of 2021, the Master of Science in Project Management accreditation was re-affirmed for the maximum five-year accreditation cycle (originally accredited in 2009) by the Project Management Institute Global Accreditation Center for Project Management Education Programs (GAC), the world's leading association for project management professionals. Accreditation is achieved by meeting the GAC’s rigorous standards, which include an assessment of program objectives and outcomes, a review of onsite and online resources, evaluations of faculty and students, and proof of continuous improvements in the area of project management.

   Concentrations and course offerings may vary by campus and/or by program modality.  Please consult with your advisor or admissions coach for the course availability each term at your campus or within your program modality.  Certain options within the program may be required at certain campuses or for certain program modalities.  Please consult with your advisor or admissions coach for requirements at your campus or for your program modality.
